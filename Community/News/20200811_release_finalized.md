# Metric Release 2020-08 is Finalized

After six months of hard work, CHAOSS is proud to release eight new metrics that can be used to measure open source community health, bringing the total number of defined metrics to 46. We also revised three existing metrics, added new focus areas, and restructured our Value Working Group to take a more accurate look at measuring value within projects.
