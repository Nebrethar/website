# Free Open Source Community Health Reports Now Available

Interested in getting a better understanding of community health for your open source projects? The CHAOSS project is proud to now offer a one-page community health report free of charge. ðŸŽ‰

This one-page PDF offers insights into the health of one of your GitHub or GitLab repositories through the following metrics:

- Mean Duration (Days) of All Closed Pull Requests
- Number of Open and Closed Issues over Time
- Fly-by and Repeat Contributor Counts per Month
- Activity Dates and Times

While these insights touch on only a few of the [46 vetted metrics CHAOSS has developed](https://chaoss.community/metrics/), we think these high-level metrics are useful in starting to develop an overall picture of the general health of your open source project. 

You can request a [copy of your community health report here](https://chaoss.community/community-reports/), and we appreciate any feedback you have!
