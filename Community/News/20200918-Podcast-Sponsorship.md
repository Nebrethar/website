# Sponsorship Opportunities for CHAOSScast

The CHAOSS Community is growing with more and more interesting conversations occurring all the time. In May, we started recording and elevating conversations about metrics, analytics, and software for open source community health through our community podcast: CHAOSScast.

The podcast has quickly become a staple of CHAOSS’ outreach. New episodes are downloaded within the first week about 40 times and our most recent episode reached 77 downloads on the first day alone. The feedback we receive is overwhelmingly positive.

**We are now seeking your help to keep the podcast “on the air”.**

We need financial support because our source of funding disappeared. We were working with a podcast network that secured sponsors and in return provided the hosting and editing services for free to us. This podcast network closed down.

In the interest of transparency, the money we seek will ensure that we can deliver the quality everyone has come to expect. Specifically, we need to pay for the hosting platform, audio editing and show note creation services. We also like to send a thank you note to our guests but the postage is negligible compared to the production costs of the podcast.

**We are open to including a sponsor message in our episodes for anyone who financially supports CHAOSScast.**
