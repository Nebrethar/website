# Augur

If you want to quickly and flexibly understand a set of open source software projects, give Augur a try! "Augur" is the core software, and "augur-community-reports", "augur-spdx" (for licensing), and "Auggie", which is a slack plugin for notifications that enables you to get push messages from Augur.

Want to get started right away without doing much work? Email a list of repository to GitHub/GitLab organizations to Augur at s@groupinformatics.org with the subject line "Augur Instance", and we will respond with a timeline within a day. The more repositories you request, the longer it takes to gather data (FYI). 

## Augur Components
1. **START HERE**: Augur is a [Flask web application](http://augur.osshealth.io), [Python library](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/library-documentation/python.html) and [REST server](http://augur.osshealth.io/static/api_docs/) that presents metrics on open source software development project health and sustainability.
2. Augur now also includes https://github.com/chaoss/augur-community reports, which provides Jupyter Notebooks that enable open source projects to ask questions of Augur's rich, validated GitHub and GitLab datasets. 
3. You can also now subscribe to slack notifications at http://auggie.augurlabs.io/#/configure from your Augur instance, at this link, which is located at the https://github.com/chaoss/augur-auggie repository. We even have a GitHub Webpage, here: https://chaoss.github.io/augur-auggie/ that consolidates the readme.md and development guide in a nifty, aesthetically pleasing template, sure to lure the real estate agent in your life. 
4. Augur License Risk Analysis: https://github.com/chaoss/augur-spdx
